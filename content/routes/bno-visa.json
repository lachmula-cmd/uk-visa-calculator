    "route_intro": "The BNO (British National Overseas) visa is a special route for British National (Overseas) status holders from Hong Kong and their family members. It allows you to live, work, and study in the UK, with a path to settlement after 5 years and citizenship after 6 years. You can apply for either a 30-month or 5-year visa. To qualify, you or your partner must hold BNO status, and you must have been a resident of Hong Kong. This route was introduced in response to changes in Hong Kong and provides a pathway to permanent residence in the UK.",
