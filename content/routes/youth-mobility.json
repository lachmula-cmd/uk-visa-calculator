    "route_intro": "The Youth Mobility Scheme visa allows young people from participating countries and territories to live and work in the UK for up to 2 years. This is a unique visa that gives young people aged 18-30 (or 18-35 for some nationalities) the opportunity to experience life in the UK with minimal restrictions. You can work, study, and travel. You don't need a job offer or sponsor, and there are no restrictions on the type of work you can do (except professional sportsperson). The visa cannot be extended, but you can apply to switch to other visa routes like Skilled Worker if you meet the eligibility requirements.",
