    "route_intro": "The Global Talent visa is for leaders or potential leaders in academia, research, arts and culture, or digital technology. This route replaced the Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) visa and offers a fast track to settlement. You don't need a job offer or sponsor, giving you the flexibility to work for yourself or for employers. To apply, you must first get an endorsement from an approved UK body in your field (unless you've won an eligible prize). After 3 or 5 years (depending on your endorsement), you can apply for indefinite leave to remain. This is one of the UK's premium visa routes for exceptionally talented individuals.",

They'll assess whether you're a leader or potential leader in your field. Some applicants (e.g., winners of certain prestigious prizes) are automatically endorsed."
