    "route_intro": "The Student visa (formerly Tier 4 General) allows international students to study in the UK at an approved education institution. You can apply if you've been offered a place on a course by a licensed student sponsor, can speak, read, write and understand English, and have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course. Your course must be with an approved educational institution that has a valid student sponsor licence. The institution will send you a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) which you'll need for your application.",
