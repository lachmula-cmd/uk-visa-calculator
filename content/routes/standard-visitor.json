    "route_intro": "The Standard Visitor visa allows you to visit the UK for tourism, business, study (short courses), medical treatment, or to visit family and friends. You cannot work or access public funds on this visa. Most visitors can stay for up to 6 months, though longer validity visas are available. You must show that you're a genuine visitor who will leave at the end of your visit, have enough money to support yourself during your trip, and can pay for your return journey. This is one of the most common UK visa types for short-term visits.",

            "question": "How long can I stay on a Standard Visitor visa?",
            "answer": "You can usually stay for up to 6 months per visit. If you apply for a longer-term visa (1, 2, 5, or 10 years), this means you can make multiple visits during that period, but each individual visit is still limited to 6 months maximum."
