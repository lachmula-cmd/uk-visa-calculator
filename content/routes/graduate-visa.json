    "route_intro": "The Graduate visa allows international students who have successfully completed an eligible course in the UK to stay and work, or look for work, for at least 2 years after their studies. PhD graduates can stay for 3 years. You must currently be in the UK on a Student visa or Tier 4 (General) visa, and your education provider must have notified the Home Office that you've successfully completed your course. There's no need for sponsorship, no minimum salary, and you can work in most jobs or be self-employed. This is an excellent route for graduates wanting UK work experience.",
