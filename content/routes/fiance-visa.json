    "route_intro": "The Fiancé(e) visa allows you to come to the UK to marry or enter into a civil partnership with a British citizen or someone settled in the UK. The visa is valid for 6 months, during which time you must marry or enter a civil partnership. After marriage, you can apply to switch to a Spouse visa from within the UK. You must meet financial, relationship, and English language requirements similar to the Spouse visa route. This is the appropriate route if you're not yet married but plan to marry in the UK shortly after arriving.",
